# csv-to-kepler-map
This repository contains code for creating a visualization of location data stored in a CSV file using the Kepler.gl library. The code reads in the CSV file, rounds the latitude and longitude values, and creates a map with colored points to represent the data. The resulting map is saved as an HTML file. This code is useful for anyone who wants to quickly and easily create a visual representation of location data for exploration or analysis.
